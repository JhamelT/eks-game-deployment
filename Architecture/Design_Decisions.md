# Architecture Design Decisions

## Design Philosophy
This project prioritizes **learning efficiency** and **cost optimization** over maximum performance, reflecting real-world constraints in analytics environments where resources are shared and budgets matter.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Fargate vs EC2 Managed Node Groups

**Decision:** AWS Fargate serverless compute

**Rationale:**
- **Learning Focus:** Eliminates node management complexity
- **Cost Efficiency:** Zero idle costs for variable learning workloads
- **Analytics Pattern Match:** Mirrors batch processing common in data engineering
- **Operational Simplicity:** No patching or capacity planning

**Trade-offs:**
- ❌ Higher per-hour cost ($0.04 vs $0.02 for t3.small)
- ❌ Cold start latency (~45-60 seconds)
- ✅ 45% total cost savings for my usage pattern
- ✅ Zero infrastructure management

**When to Reconsider:** Workloads requiring >16 hours/day or persistent storage

### 2. Application Load Balancer vs Network Load Balancer

**Decision:** Application Load Balancer (ALB)

**Rationale:**
- HTTP/HTTPS termination for web applications
- Path-based routing for future microservices
- Better Kubernetes ingress integration
- SSL/TLS certificate management

**Analytics Context:** Data dashboards and APIs benefit from Layer 7 routing

### 3. OIDC Integration vs Node-Level IAM

**Decision:** OIDC provider with service account IAM roles

**Rationale:**
- Fine-grained security (each service gets minimal permissions)
- Follows AWS security best practices
- Required for multi-service architectures
- Clear audit trail

**Security Principle:** Least privilege access

### 4. Helm vs kubectl for Controller Installation

**Decision:** Helm chart installation

**Rationale:**
- Cleaner configuration management
- Easier updates and version control
- Industry standard for Kubernetes packages
- Demonstrates modern tooling knowledge

## Technical Implementation Choices

### Networking
**Public/Private subnet design** - Standard AWS pattern with security-first approach

### Resources
**Minimal allocation (0.25 vCPU, 0.5GB)** - Matches Fargate minimums, cost-conscious learning

### Monitoring
**kubectl-based** initially, with clear evolution path to CloudWatch and Prometheus

## What I'd Implement To Enhance The Project

1. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Current: Imperative eksctl commands
   - Better: Terraform modules
   - Why: Version control and reproducibility

2. **Observability**
   - Current: Basic kubectl monitoring
   - Better: CloudWatch insights with dashboards
   - Why: Data-driven optimization decisions

3. **Security-First Approach**
   - Current: Minimal security configuration
   - Better: Pod Security Standards, Network Policies
   - Why: Security should be built-in

## Evolution Roadmap

### Next Month: Production Readiness
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Monitoring and alerting

### Next Quarter: Advanced Features
- Service mesh implementation
- Multi-environment automation
- Advanced security policies

## Decision Framework for Future Projects

**Evaluation Criteria:**
1. **Technical Fit:** Does it solve the problem?
2. **Cost Impact:** Immediate and long-term costs?
3. **Learning Value:** What skills does it develop?
4. **Operational Complexity:** Who maintains it?

**Documentation Template:**
- **Context:** What problem are we solving?
- **Options:** What alternatives were considered?
- **Decision:** What was chosen and why?
- **Trade-offs:** Expected outcomes and compromises
